# Odin-Recipes HTML Project

At the completion of the HTML Foundations Section was a project to create a simple website that hosts recipes using the HTML Skills we have learned up to this point.

The project assigns a task to build a rudimentary recipes site that houses an index page with a list of recipes. Each of these recipes listed contains a hyperlink that navigates the user to a subpage which contains additional details about the recipe.

### REQUIRED SKILLS

---

This project requires the use of these basic HTML skills:

- Creating an index page with appropriate HTML Elements
- Working with Text
- Using headers
- Adding hyperlinks
- Adding pictures
- use of lists both ordered and unordered
- GIT Commits
  - Built a repository on GitHub
  - Cloned repository to local machine
  - Utilized _Atomic Commits_ throughout the project

### ADDITIONAL SKILLS

---

Additional skills that I utilized but were not required for the assignment were:

- Sections - I found it easier to utilize the _generic section element_ when organizing the recieps between the Title, Description, Ingrediants, an d Steps sections of the recipe pages.
  -Command Line Interface - For GIT Commits and for making directories and new files I utilized the Terminal built into VS Code. The goal is to continue to gain efficiencies in how I interact with the computer as I progress through my coursework.
